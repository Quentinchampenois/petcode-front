# Petcode Application (Front-End)

Petcode is a ReactJS application for hosting a pet's information. It is a single page application that allows users to create, read, update, and delete their pet's information. The application is built with a Rails API backend and a ReactJS frontend. The application is styled with Semantic UI React and custom CSS.

Using petcode you can register default informations for your pet, such as name, breed, age, and weight. You can also add additional information such as allergies, medications, and vet information. You can also upload a picture of your pet to be displayed on the home page. This page is accessible through A QR code on your pet's medallion for exaample.
